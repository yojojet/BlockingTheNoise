NOx comes from exhaust gases.
NH3 comes from mixing of urine and manure from cows, chicken and pigs.
These nitrogen fall down on the earth, having too much of this is bad for nature. It shrinks biodiversity. Too much nitrogen in the air is also not good for human health, it costs everyone approximately 4 months of their lives.

For years, too much nitrogen fell on Dutch land, but recently this has become a legislative problem. In 2019 because of a statement from “de raad van staten”, the judge decided that the government didn’t do enough to protect nature. That’s why no more nitrogen is allowed to be emitted in the Netherlands. Building more roads, more houses, bigger barns and expanding airports lead to more nitrogen in that air. That’s why these projects are all on hold.

The nitrogen emission of Holland is amongst the highest in the world, it is the highest in the whole of Europe.
46% of the emissions come from agriculture. 35% comes from abroad and what’s left comes from traffic, industry and households.

Because of this there is a huge shortage of housing. Normal people with a normal job are ot able to get housing for themselves. No licences are given to build more houses near nature     areas, this might even get worse if the European Union makes the rules even stricter.

The biggest chunk of emissions come from agriculture, that is why the government wanted to shrink this section. The government wanted to buy farmers and then shut the farm down. This led to a huge uproar in the country, since the country is traditionally a farmers nation. The dissatisfaction with the government was overly visible when the “Boeren Burger Beweging” won in almost every province in the “Eerste kamer” elections. Most people voted for this party to support the farmers, but the actual plans of this party are concerning. Previous governments have invested in preversing of nature and in new technologies. The BBB now wants to reverse all these decisions, because they might be annoying to the typical old fashioned farmer. In reality, most farmers are very high tech and they need investments. Also money of the tax-payer would be washed down the drain.

How can we lower nitrogen emissions? 
There is certainly room for improvements in the agricultural section.

It seems as if the farmers and the governments are running in circles. There are enough technologies to cut down emissions in the agricultural sector. The problem lies within the legislative world. These technologies have to be approved by the government, who doesn’t know anything about how these technologies work. In other words, it is as if a child from primary school has to check the maths equations of a university student. 
The government is not capable of checking the technologies. That is why no technologies are implemented, or only bad technologies are implemented. 

The problem on the side of the farmers is their attitude?
They are willing to make an investment in new technologies, but they can’t because the government might disapprove of it, or the new government might disapprove of it while it was okay before. The problem is that the farmers are nog getting together as one unit and promoting these technologies, so that the government approves.

A solution a la Elon Musk might work.
Elon musk has “solved” the electrical car problem. The electrical cars were not getting on, because there were not enough places to charge them. That’s why he built the charge stations himself. By promoting himself a lot, the company became big.

If someone from the outside, who does know how the technologies work and who doesn’t have the same stubborn attitude of a farmer, promotes a technology that becomes so big that the government has no option to approve it forever. Then the cycle is broken.

This someone has two things he needs to do: 
Convince the government so well that they can ever disapprove of it or take back their approval. (make it super popular, too big to ignore)
Get the farmers together to support him and use the products.

This way the agricultural part of the emissions will be lowered.

How can we implement coding into this?
Create a website to promote the technological product

Music? Fried Food?
We’ll use music to lower the guards of people, so that they will like us easier.
We’ll use fried food to bribe politicians

Frying food is not good for the air. The fat particles released in the air are like soap in water, it will float on top of the air. This will influence weather and has influenced weather in places like London. It seems that the fat has an influence on clouds and rain.
Maybe these effects are good? It might have a cooling effect, which is nice in the global warming phase we are in.

Also frying food wastes more than for example putting food in the oven.

Other “solutions” to lower emissions in general
Create awareness on the topic → social media, website
This is not really needed, people are already aware and we will not be adding anything to what is already out there.
Households:
Ways in which households lower their own emissions → “”
Eat less meat more biological
Traffic:
More cycling and public transport or electric cars
agriculture:
Biological circular agriculture
New technologies: https://joz.nl/stikstof-reduceren/ 
https://www.melkveebedrijf.nl/wet-en-regelgeving/stikstofaanpak/negen-technieken-om-zonder-krimp-stikstofuitstoot-te-verminderen/ 
Less animals and plants
Less farms

Industries
Technologies
Big polluters have to pay as well: biggest polluter Schiphol, tata steel. Make them invest in new technologies. They made a mess, so they have to do something about it.

Abroad:
They have to lower their emissions as well

The problem. In 2015 the “PAS” Programma aanpak stikstof was introduced, because there was too much stikstof in the air. The problem is that this law is corrupt. This law ensured that projects could go ahead because nitrogen would be worked on in the future. 
Someone asks you: “Do you want another cookie?”
And you will answer with: ‘’I’ll eat the entire box, because they might build a gym here in two years!”
The entire law was set to fail from the beginning and it did. The nitrogen emissions were basically ignored, until the court ordered the government to do something about it. Because the agricultural sector is the biggest, changes have to be made in that sector. 
The politicians instead of making plans to solve the problem, convinced the farmers that their existence is in danger. Populistic ideas were spread instead of solving the problem. Farmers went protesting and the new rules after the PAS were cancelled. These new rules were not to erase the existence of farmers, the farmers thought it was so. Then we get into the beginning of this document. No action was taken, but now the government must take action otherwise the government might fall. So they wanted to buy farmers and close their farms. The nightmare actually became true, because they thought it would happen, a self fulfilling prophecy. Now a solution has to be found where the farmers won’t lose their jobs and way of life and where emissions are lowered.

Music to spread awareness.

All the bad. 

How to promote the company and product. Appear on tv shows, do something that will make you appear in the news, do something so that people talk about it, advertise on social media, talk to farmers and farmer organisations, talk to the government.
